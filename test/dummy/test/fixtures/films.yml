    Thomas Anderson is a computer programmer who maintains a double life as the

    Smith, appear determined to prevent this. Neo eventually meets Morpheus,
    who warns that once he shows Neo the Matrix, he will not be able to "go

  name: Mission Impossible
  synopsis: >
    Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is part of an Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team
    led by Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) to prevent the theft of the non-official
    cover (NOC) list from the American embassy in Prague. The mission goes
    hopelessly wrong, with several team members killed and the NOC list stolen.
    Hunt sees Phelps, via Phelps' video glasses, being shot, and Phelps' wife
    Claire (Emmanuelle Béart) die in a car bomb, leaving him the only living
    member. Hunt later regroups with IMF director Eugene Kittridge (Henry
    Czerny) to debrief, but learns that the job was a setup and the NOC list a
    fake by IMF to lure out a mole within IMF, who IMF believed would sell the
    NOC list to an arms dealer known as "Max" as part of "Job 314". As Hunt is
    the only member left, Kittridge suspects him of being the mole, but Hunt
    creates a distraction to flee before his capture. Hunt returns to the
    Prague safehouse and realizes "Job 314" refers to the Bible verse, Job
    3:14, with "Job" as an agent of Max. He is able to communicate with Max via
    online Bible forums, and arranges a meeting. Hunt is taken to Max (Vanessa
    Redgrave), and warns her the NOC list she possesses has a tracking device
    that will lure the CIA there, while promising to deliver the real NOC list
    for $10 million and the identity of Job.

  name: Inception
  synopsis: >
    Dominick "Dom" Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and business partner Arthur (Joseph
    Gordon-Levitt) are "extractors", people who perform corporate espionage
    using an experimental military technology to infiltrate the subconscious of
    their targets and extract information while experiencing shared dreaming.
    Their latest target is Japanese businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe). Tiered
    "dream within a dream" strategies are used and dreamers awaken by a "kick"
    such as falling. They must avoid "projections" (people who inhabit the
    dream) since they will try to awaken the extractors to expell them from the
    dream. If the dreamer is the one who awakens, the dream "collapses". Each
    extractor carries a totem, a small object whose behavior only its owner can
    predict, used to determine whether a dreamer is in someone else's dream.
    Cobb's totem is implied to be a spinning top that spins perpetually in the
    dream state. The extraction from Saito fails when sabotaged by a memory of
    Cobb's deceased wife Mal (Marion Cotillard).
